# Password Generator
## Summary
This program lets the user type in the amount regarded to each type of character they want, such as letters, numbers, and symbols. Each type of character has its own variable which stores a list of strings.

Create 3 other variables that will hold the input value as an integer representing the amount of each type of character. The integer will be the max of the range for the for loop. Used the choice method to pick the specific string from the letters, numbers and symbols list, then add them to a new empty list that stored the chosen string as a password list.

Finally, use the shuffle method to randomize the order of the password list, then use a for loop to ru through the password list, then adds them into an empty variable called password.

## Objective  
- Implement input value into range( ) as a maximum number of the range
- Use choice( ) method to select the specific data from the list
- Use shuffle( ) method to randomize a list of string
