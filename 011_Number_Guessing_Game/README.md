# Number Guessing Game
## Summary
This game will let the player choose a difficulty and guess a random integer from 1 to 100. The difficulty level for easy has 10 attempts, and hard has 5 attempts to choose from. There will be a message after every attempt that tells the player if the number is too large or too low compared to the actual number and shows the player how many attempts they have left.


## Objective
- Setup two constants that represent the difficulty of easy and hard.
- Create a function that will take in the input value for the difficulty from the player and return the constants.
- Create a function to play the game that will run the difficulty and check the answer over the attempts.
