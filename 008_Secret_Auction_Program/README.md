# Secret Auction Program
## Summary
This program lets bidders take turns entering their names and bid prices, while every turn will clear out the text from the previous entry to ensure the price will not be exposed to the next person. Finally, it will compare all bids and find the winner.

## Objective
- Make use of the dictionary's traits by storing bidder data in key-value pairs
- Create a for loop that compares prices and finds the highest bids; it will also require a re-bid if some bids are the same priceÂ
